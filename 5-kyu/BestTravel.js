/*
John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ... Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between these towns. ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60]. John is tired of driving and he says to Mary that he doesn't want to drive more than t = 174 miles and he will visit only 3 towns.

Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that the sum of the distances is the biggest possible to please Mary and John?

Example:

With list ls and 3 towns to visit they can make a choice between: [50,55,57],[50,55,58],[50,55,60],[50,57,58],[50,57,60],[50,58,60],[55,57,58],[55,57,60],[55,58,60],[57,58,60].

The sums of distances are then: 162, 163, 165, 165, 167, 168, 170, 172, 173, 175.

The biggest possible sum taking a limit of 174 into account is then 173 and the distances of the 3 corresponding towns is [55, 58, 60].

The function chooseBestSum (or choose_best_sum or ... depending on the language) will take as parameters t (maximum sum of distances, integer >= 0), k (number of towns to visit, k >= 1) and ls (list of distances, all distances are positive or null integers and this list has at least one element). The function returns the "best" sum ie the biggest possible sum of k distances less than or equal to the given limit t, if that sum exists, or otherwise nil, null, None, Nothing, depending on the language. With C++, C, Rust, Swift, Go, Kotlin return -1.

Examples:

ts = [50, 55, 56, 57, 58] choose_best_sum(163, 3, ts) -> 163

xs = [50] choose_best_sum(163, 3, xs) -> nil (or null or ... or -1 (C++, C, Rust, Swift, Go)

ys = [91, 74, 73, 85, 73, 81, 87] choose_best_sum(230, 3, ys) -> 228

Note: don't modify the input list ls

    // To get k-combinations of a set, we want to join each element
    // with all (k-1)-combinations of the other elements. The set of
    // these k-sized sets would be the desired result. However, as we
    // represent sets with lists, we need to take duplicates into
    // account. To avoid producing duplicates and also unnecessary
    // computing, we use the following approach: each element i
    // divides the list into three: the preceding elements, the
    // current element i, and the subsequent elements. For the first
    // element, the list of preceding elements is empty. For element i,
    // we compute the (k-1)-computations of the subsequent elements,
    // join each with the element i, and store the joined to the set of
    // computed k-combinations. We do not need to take the preceding
    // elements into account, because they have already been the i:th
    // element so they are already computed and stored. When the length
    // of the subsequent list drops below (k-1), we cannot find any
    // (k-1)-combs, hence the upper limit for the iteration:
    combs = [];

      // head is a list that includes only our current element.
      head = set.slice(i, i + 1);
      // We take smaller combinations from the subsequent elements
      tailcombs = k_combinations(set.slice(i + 1), k - 1);
      // For each (k-1)-combination we join it with the current
      // and store it to the set of k-combinations.
